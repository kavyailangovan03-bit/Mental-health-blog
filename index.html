      The dataset represents insights from 20 employees across departments such as Marketing, Sales, HR, IT, and Design.
      It includes key attributes like work hours, happiness scores, stress levels, remote work percentage, years of experience,
      and productivity ratings. These data points reveal how workplace habits and remote flexibility impact both mental health
      and output efficiency. This visualization aims to identify trends that can guide better work-life balance strategies
      and improve organizational well-being.
