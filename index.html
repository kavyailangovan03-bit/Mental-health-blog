    <h2 id="about-title" style="margin:0 0 10px 0;font-size:16px">About the dataset</h2>
    <p class="about">
      This dataset contains anonymized records for 20 employees across several departments (Marketing, Sales, HR, IT, Design). Each record includes weekly work hours, self-reported happiness and stress scores (1–10), percentage of time spent working remotely, tenure in years, gender, age, and a productivity score. The data is synthetic but realistic — designed to explore relationships between remote work, stress and productivity and to inform employee wellbeing strategies. Use the charts below to quickly identify which teams have higher stress averages and how remote work correlates with productivity.
